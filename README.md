# 🔐 Manual Base64 Encoder

A **manual** implementation of the Base64 encoding algorithm written in **C++**. This tool reads the contents of a file and encodes it into Base64 format **without using any external libraries**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Manually constructs the Base64 encoding table using ASCII.
- 📂 Reads files in binary mode and encodes their contents.
- ✏️ Supports the following output modes:
  - Overwriting the original file with Base64.
  - Printing the Base64-encoded content to stdout.
  - Writing encoded output to a separate file.
